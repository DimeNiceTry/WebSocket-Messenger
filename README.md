# WebSocket-Messenger
Messenger app based on Postgre using socket.io, JS and HTML-CSS

I used Aiven Database service to save messages in DB, so you need first set up the connetion string and create DB. There is ERD of my database, however there is backup of it  in the project files tho:

**HOW TO USE APP**

First of all you need to start server. To do it you need run Git Bash on workspace.

Then you need to write "node server.js" which stars server on localhost on port 5000.

Then white "localhost:5000" on search query. Well Done! Your Messenger is running.
